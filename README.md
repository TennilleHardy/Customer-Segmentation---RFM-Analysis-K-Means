# Customer-Segmentation---RFM-Analysis-K-Means

This notebook explores customer segmentation by combing two fundamental techniques: RFM Analysis, and K-Means Clustering.
The objective is to categorise customers into segments based on their usage of the product. The four categories customers can be segemented into are:
    * Champions (or power users): highest recency + highest frequency + highest monetary
    * Loyal Customers: moderate recency + moderate frequency + moderate monetary
    * Recent Customers: high recency + lower frequency + moderate monetary
    * At-Risk Customers: lower recency + lower frequency
    
This notebook makes use of a public dataset found on Kaggle called 'Online Retail II dataset' (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabilan45/online-retail-ii-dataset)
